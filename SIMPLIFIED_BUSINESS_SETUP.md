# ðŸš€ Simplified Multi-Business Setup Guide

## **New Simplified Flow**

### **How It Works:**
1. **First Business** = Created automatically during registration
2. **Additional Businesses** = Premium users can create more via business management
3. **Business Context** = Dashboard shows "Welcome back to [Business Name]"
4. **Multi-Business Feature** = Only shows if user has multiple businesses

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Run Database Scripts (In Order)**

1. **Run `106-simple-business-setup.sql`** - Creates all business tables and functions
2. **Run `107-fix-sales-table.sql`** - Fixes sales table RLS issues
3. **Run `108-create-default-business.sql`** - Creates default business for existing users

### **Step 2: Test the Flow**

1. **Login to the application**
2. **Check Dashboard** - Should show "Welcome back to [Business Name]"
3. **Go to MyExtras** - Multi-Business Management should be hidden (only 1 business)
