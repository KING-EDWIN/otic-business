-- Complete authentication fix
-- This addresses all authentication and session issues

-- 1. Completely disable RLS on all tables

    LOOP
        EXECUTE FORMAT('ALTER TABLE %I DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;', tbl_name.table_name);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- 2. Grant all permissions to all roles
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO service_role;

-- Grant table permissions

DECLARE
    tbl_name RECORD;

END $$;

-- Grant function permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO service_role;

-- Grant sequence permissions
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
