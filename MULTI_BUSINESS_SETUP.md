# Multi-Business Management Setup

## 🚀 **Multi-Business Management System is Ready!**

I've created a comprehensive multi-business management system with the following features:

### **📁 Files Created:**

1. **Database Schema**: `101-multi-business-schema.sql`
2. **Service**: `src/services/businessManagementService.ts`
