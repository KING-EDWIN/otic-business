# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Database Functions Required

## **The Problem:**
The application is trying to use RPC functions that don't exist in the database:
- `get_user_businesses`
- `can_create_business` 
- `get_business_members`

## **The Solution:**
You need to run the SQL script `109-create-business-functions.sql` in your Supabase dashboard.

## **Steps to Fix:**

### 1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
- Open your Supabase project dashboard
- Go to the SQL Editor

### 2. **Run the SQL Script**
- Copy the entire content of `109-create-business-functions.sql`
- Paste it into the SQL Editor
- Click "Run" to execute

### 3. **Verify Functions Created**
After running, you should see these functions in your database:
- `get_user_businesses(uuid)`
- `can_create_business(uuid)`
- `get_business_members(uuid)`
- `switch_business_context(uuid, uuid)`

## **What This Does:**
- Creates proper RPC functions for multi-business management
- Uses real live data from your database
- No fallbacks or dummy data
- Primary connections will work properly

## **After Running:**
- The 404 errors will disappear
- Business management will work with real data
- All functions will use live database connections

**This is the only step needed to fix the current errors!** ðŸŽ¯
