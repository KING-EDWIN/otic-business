# Supabase Storage Setup for OTIC Vision

## Quick Setup (Optional)

The OTIC Vision system works without Supabase storage (uses base64 fallback), but for production you'll want to set up storage:

### 1. Create Storage Bucket

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** → **Buckets**
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Name: `product-images`
4. Set as **Public** (for easy access)
5. Click **Create Bucket**

### 2. Set Storage Policies

Go to **Storage** → **Policies** and add:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public access to view images
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to view images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
```

### 3. Test Upload

The system will automatically:
- Try Supabase storage first
- Fall back to base64 if storage fails
- Work perfectly for testing either way

## Current Status

✅ **Working without storage** - Images stored as base64 in database
✅ **RGB token generation** - Fully functional
✅ **Product recognition** - Complete testing flow
✅ **Token comparison** - Detailed visualization

The system is ready for testing regardless of storage setup!
