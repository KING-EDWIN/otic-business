## Implementation Files

### Backend Services
- `src/services/tierService.ts` - Core tier management logic
- `src/services/subscriptionService.ts` - Updated subscription handling
- `create-tier-system.sql` - Database schema and initial data

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/TierRestrictionNew.tsx` - Feature access control
- `src/components/PricingPage.tsx` - Pricing and tier selection
- `src/components/TierUpgradeRequests.tsx` - Admin tier management

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Feature Access Control
```typescript
// Check if user has access to a feature
const hasAccess = await tierService.hasFeatureAccess(userId, 'ai_analytics')

// Track feature usage
await tierService.trackFeatureUsage(userId, 'pos_system', 1)
```

#### 2. Tier Management
```typescript
// Get all available tiers
const tiers = await tierService.getTiers()

// Get user's current subscription
const subscription = await tierService.getUserSubscription(userId)

// Create new subscription
const result = await tierService.createSubscription(userId, tierId, paymentMethod)
```

#### 3. Pricing and Comparison
```typescript
// Get tier comparison for pricing page
const comparison = await tierService.getTierComparison(userId)

// Check upgrade eligibility
const canUpgrade = await tierService.canUpgradeToTier(userId, targetTierId)
```
