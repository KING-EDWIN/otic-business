-- 9. Ensure RLS is enabled on all tables
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE businesses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE business_memberships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE product_categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE product_suppliers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE stock_movements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 10. Create or replace the get_user_businesses function with proper error handling
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_businesses(user_id_param UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id UUID,
  name TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  business_type TEXT,
  industry TEXT,
  website TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  city TEXT,
  state TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  postal_code TEXT,
  tax_id TEXT,
  registration_number TEXT,
  currency TEXT,
  timezone TEXT,
  logo_url TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  settings JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_by UUID,
  user_role TEXT,
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    b.id,
    b.name,
    b.description,
    b.business_type,
    b.industry,
    b.website,
    b.phone,
    b.email,
    b.address,
    b.city,
    b.state,
    b.country,
    b.postal_code,
    b.tax_id,
    b.registration_number,
    b.currency,
    b.timezone,
    b.logo_url,
    b.status,
    b.settings,
    b.created_at,
    b.updated_at,
    b.created_by,
    bm.role as user_role,
    bm.joined_at
  FROM businesses b
  INNER JOIN business_memberships bm ON b.id = bm.business_id
  WHERE bm.user_id = user_id_param
  ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;
END;
$$;

-- 11. Grant necessary permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_businesses(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- 12. Test the function
SELECT 'RLS and Auth fixes applied successfully' as status;
