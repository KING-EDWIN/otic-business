# ðŸš€ Quick Fix Summary - Multi-Business System

## **âœ… Issues Fixed:**

- Created business membership for user (role: owner)
- Data is accessible via REST API

### **3. Updated Service Layer**
- businessManagementService now falls back to direct queries when RPC functions don't exist

## **ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Optional):**

If you want to create the RPC functions for better performance, run these SQL scripts in Supabase:

1. **`106-simple-business-setup.sql`** - Creates all business tables and functions
2. **`107-fix-sales-table.sql`** - Fixes sales table RLS issues

## **ðŸ§ª Test the Application:**

1. **Login to the application**
2. **Check Dashboard** - Should show "Welcome back to My Business"
3. **Go to MyExtras** - Should work without errors
4. **Go to Business Management** - Should show the test business
