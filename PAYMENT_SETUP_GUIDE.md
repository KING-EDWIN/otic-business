# Payment System Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Complete Payment System Implementation**

I've implemented a comprehensive payment system for your Otic Business application with the exact payment methods you specified. Here's what you need to do:

### 📋 **Step 1: Run Database Scripts**

Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor in this order:

1. **Create Payment Tables:**
   ```sql
   -- Run: create-payment-tables.sql
   ```

2. **Setup Payment Storage:**
   ```sql
   -- Run: setup-payment-storage.sql
   ```

### 🎯 **Step 2: Payment Flow Overview**

#### **For Users:**
1. **Select Tier** → User clicks "Upgrade Now" on any plan
2. **Payment Instructions** → Modal opens with your exact payment methods:
   - **MTN Mobile Money**: Code 720504, Name: Otic Foundation
   - **Airtel Money**: Code 4379529, Name: Otic Foundation  
   - **Bank Transfer**: Stanbic Bank, Account: 9030025213237 UGX
3. **Upload Proof** → User uploads payment screenshot/receipt
4. **Submit Request** → Payment request created with "pending" status

#### **For Admins:**
1. **View Requests** → Go to Dashboard → Payments tab
2. **Verify Payment** → Check uploaded proof, verify with bank/mobile money
3. **Approve/Reject** → Click "Verify" or "Reject" with notes
4. **Auto-Upgrade** → User's tier automatically updates when verified
